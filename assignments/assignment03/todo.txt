1. Create a new project and install Express.js (with Nodemon)
2. Install one of the templating engines
3. Add two routes:
    - "/" => Holds a <form> that allows users to input their name
    - "/users" => Outputs an <ul> with the usernames (or some error text)
4. Make sure to also use layouts/includes
